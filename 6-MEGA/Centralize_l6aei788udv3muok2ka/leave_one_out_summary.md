## üìä Ranked Hypotheses

| Rank | Hypothesis | Simplicity | Train Acc. | Solomonoff Score | Solomonoff Weight |
|------|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | The pattern formed by cells with the same color in the input grid is moved to the center of the output grid. | 0.744 | 0.880 | 0.654 | 0.081 |
| 2 | The object consisting of '5' cells in the input grid is moved to the center of the grid in the output. | 0.653 | 0.880 | 0.575 | 0.071 |
| 3 | The objects in the grid are shifted from their original position to the center of the grid. | 0.598 | 0.880 | 0.526 | 0.065 |
| 4 | The objects in the grid are moved to the center of the grid and their orientation is changed to form a cross shape. | 0.558 | 0.880 | 0.491 | 0.061 |
| 5 | The objects in the input grid are shifted to the center of the grid in the output grid, maintaining their original shape and color. | 0.548 | 0.880 | 0.482 | 0.060 |
| 6 | The objects in the grid are shifted from the top-right corner to the center of the grid. | 0.538 | 0.880 | 0.473 | 0.058 |
| 7 | The objects in the input grid are moved to the center and reoriented to form a plus sign (+). | 0.533 | 0.880 | 0.469 | 0.058 |
| 8 | The shape represented by the cells of the same color in the input grid is moved to the center of the output grid, maintaining its original configuration. | 0.513 | 0.880 | 0.451 | 0.056 |
| 9 | The objects in the input grid are moved to the center of the grid in the output. | 0.508 | 0.880 | 0.447 | 0.055 |
| 10 | The objects in the input grid are moved to be centered in the output grid. | 0.492 | 0.880 | 0.433 | 0.054 |
| 11 | The objects in the input grid are mirrored along the center of the grid to produce the output grid. | 0.623 | 0.680 | 0.424 | 0.052 |
| 12 | The objects in the input grid are relocated to the center of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions to each other. | 0.508 | 0.800 | 0.406 | 0.050 |
| 13 | The object consisting of 5 cells is repositioned such that its center remains the same but its shape is changed to form a '+' sign. | 0.508 | 0.760 | 0.386 | 0.048 |
| 14 | The 5-cell object in the input grid is repositioned in the output grid so that it forms a cross shape centered in the middle of the grid. | 0.437 | 0.880 | 0.385 | 0.048 |
| 15 | The object in the input grid is relocating and changing its orientation to form a plus (+) sign in the center of the output grid. | 0.472 | 0.800 | 0.378 | 0.047 |
| 16 | The pattern of colored cells in the input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to obtain the output grid. | 0.492 | 0.760 | 0.374 | 0.046 |
| 17 | The objects in the input grid are transformed into a cross shape in the output grid, maintaining the same color and size, but changing their position and shape. | 0.462 | 0.680 | 0.314 | 0.039 |
| 18 | The input grid objects are repositioned at the center of the grid in the output, forming a 'plus' (+) shape. | 0.337 | 0.880 | 0.296 | 0.037 |
| 19 | The 'cross' shape made by 5 elements of the same color in the input grid is shifted diagonally to the right and down by one position each. | 0.382 | 0.760 | 0.290 | 0.036 |
| 20 | The objects in the input grid are repositioned and reoriented in the output grid to form a 'plus' shape (+) with the center cell of the object moved to the center of the grid, and the other cells arranged above, below, to the left, and to the right of the center cell. | 0.176 | 0.720 | 0.127 | 0.016 |
