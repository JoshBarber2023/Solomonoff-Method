# üßÆ Leave-One-Out Solomonoff Analysis for `Centralize_l6aei788udv3muok2ka`

**Held-out example index (1-based):** 3


## üìä Ranked Hypotheses

| Rank | Hypothesis | Simplicity | Train Acc. | Solomonoff Score | Solomonoff Weight |
|------|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Objects are moved from their original location to the center of the grid maintaining their relational pattern | 0.573 | 0.880 | 0.504 | 0.265 |
| 2 | The input objects which are cross-shaped clusters of cells are repositioned to the centre of the grid. They maintain their color and form. | 0.487 | 0.840 | 0.409 | 0.215 |
| 3 | The pattern structure for an unique shape rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise locally between the input grid and output grid without affecting other objects or the entire input grid. | 0.497 | 0.700 | 0.348 | 0.183 |
| 4 | The objects in the input grid move towards the center of the grid, maintaining their original shape and color. | 0.382 | 0.900 | 0.344 | 0.181 |
| 5 | The object in the input grid moves diagonally downward from the top left corner towards the center of the grid, maintaining its original shape and color. | 0.291 | 0.880 | 0.256 | 0.135 |
| 6 | The objects in the grid move from their initial positions to form a plus '+' shape centered on the grid. The cell at the center of the object becomes the center of the '+' shape in the output, and the rest of the cells position themselves around this center cell. | 0.045 | 0.880 | 0.040 | 0.021 |
