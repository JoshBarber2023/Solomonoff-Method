# üßÆ Leave-One-Out Solomonoff Analysis for `Color_corners_of_the_rectangle_l6ab1kfb2tyukiwz069`

**Held-out example index (1-based):** 3


## üìä Ranked Hypotheses

| Rank | Hypothesis | Simplicity | Train Acc. | Solomonoff Score | Solomonoff Weight |
|------|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | The transformation is selecting the corners of the green square and changing them to another color (represented as 7). The center remains unaltered. | 0.518 | 1.000 | 0.518 | 0.207 |
| 2 | The objects in the input grid are modified by changing the cells in the corners of the object (if the object is a square/rectangle) to a different color (7), while the remaining cells remain the same. | 0.492 | 1.000 | 0.492 | 0.196 |
| 3 | The transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves converting corner cells from '3 (green)' to '7 (light blue)' in all squares of 3x3 '3 (green)' cells existing in the grid. | 0.447 | 0.900 | 0.403 | 0.161 |
| 4 | The output grid is formed by changing the cells with 3 (green) color that are in the corners of the object to 7 (red) while retaining the other cells as they are. | 0.352 | 1.000 | 0.352 | 0.140 |
| 5 | The transformation process changes a 3-valued cell located around the corner of a 3-cluster array into 7. | 0.397 | 0.880 | 0.349 | 0.139 |
| 6 | All green-colored objects outlined by zeros at cardinal directions results in a transformation of objects at the corners to a new value in the output. | 0.236 | 1.000 | 0.236 | 0.094 |
| 7 | The 3 by 3 green section centered in the grid changes to have only the number 3 (green) cells forming a cross with one cell in each direction (up, down, left and right) from the center. The four corners are transformed into number 7 cells. | 0.176 | 0.900 | 0.158 | 0.063 |
