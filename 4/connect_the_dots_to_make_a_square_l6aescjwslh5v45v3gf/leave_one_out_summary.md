# üßÆ Leave-One-Out Solomonoff Analysis for `connect_the_dots_to_make_a_square_l6aescjwslh5v45v3gf`

**Held-out example index (1-based):** 4


## üìä Ranked Hypotheses

| Rank | Hypothesis | Simplicity | Train Acc. | Solomonoff Score | Solomonoff Weight |
|------|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | The '6 (magenta)' cells in the input grid, generate '5 (cyan)' cells around them in the following formation: above, below, to the left and to the right of the '6 (magenta)' cells in the output grid, forming a cross pattern. | 0.347 | 0.693 | 0.240 | 0.272 |
| 2 | The transformation involves creating a square of '5' cells around the '6' cells in the input grid. | 0.402 | 0.520 | 0.209 | 0.236 |
| 3 | The '6 (magenta)' cells are surrounded by '5 (green)' cells in the cardinal directions, forming a cross pattern around them. | 0.216 | 0.760 | 0.164 | 0.186 |
| 4 | The 6 (magenta) cells are surrounded by 5 (green) cells in the output grid forming a diamond shape around them. The diamond shape is formed towards the centre of the grid, regardless of the initial position of the 6 (magenta) cells. | 0.176 | 0.600 | 0.106 | 0.119 |
| 5 | The input grid transforms to the output grid by creating a pattern around the magenta cell(s) in the shape of the letter 'C'. This pattern starts from the top left of the magenta cell and follows clockwise direction, leaving one cell empty at top right. The pattern is filled with the cell value 5. | 0.141 | 0.627 | 0.088 | 0.100 |
| 6 | The transformation fills the grid around the magenta cells (6) with cyan cells (5), forming a square shape. The size of the square depends on the relative positions of the magenta cells. | 0.221 | 0.347 | 0.077 | 0.087 |
